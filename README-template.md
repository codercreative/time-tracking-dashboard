## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Centering the container in the middle of the browser window:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--very-dark-blue);
  font-family: "Rubik", sans-serif;
  color: var(--white);

  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

User overflow hidden to make sure that the top of the activity icons are cut off:

```css
.icon-card {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
